Live-Helper: Build using tmpfs
==============================

use "lh config --tmpfs true" to enable.

you may specify mount-options with --tmpfs-options, e.g.

	lh config --tmpfs-options "size=6G"

to set the maximum size of the ramdisk to 6GB.

"lh build" will then mount a tmpfs into the "tmpfs" directory and the build process
will take place there.

after the build the result and the cache will reside on the tmpfs, so if you
want to keep them you should move or copy them to somewhere else.
everything inside the "tmpfs" directory will be lost when umounting it, so if
you want to save the cache for later builds you have to move (or copy) it:
	
	mv tmpfs/cache .

live-helper will not umount the "tmpfs" unless you run "lh clean --tmpfs"
or "lh clean --all", so if you are going to do multiple builds without
umounting the "tmpfs" you do not need to backup the cache, it will stay there
and will be used for the next build.
